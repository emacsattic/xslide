* INSTALLATION

1. Unzip the distribution.

   This should extract the files listed in the manifest above.

   The files have DOS-style line breaks.  You may need to use "unzip
   -a" or "gunzip -a" to convert the line ends in the files to your
   local convention.

2. Copy the .el files to your emacs site-lisp directory (e.g.,
   /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp) or some other directory that is on
   your Emacs load path.

3. Load xslide.el (M-x load-file RET xslide.el) then byte
   compile the .el files using C-0 M-x byte-recompile-directory and
   supplying the path name of the directory containing the .el files.

   The provided makefile also has rules for byte-compiling the files.

   If you byte-compiled a previous version of the files, you must
   byte-compile the new files (or remove the old .elc files) so that
   autoload loads the correct versions.

4. Add the elisp code in dot_emacs to your .emacs file.

5. Restart Emacs (or, if it's easier for you, evaluate the code that
   you just added to your .emacs file).

6. When you visit a file with an extension of .xsl or .fo, xsl-mode
   will automatically be loaded.

7. To find out more about xsl-mode, type C-h m from within an XSL
   file.

8. To customize xsl-mode font-lock colours, etc., browse the `Xsl'
   Customize group after loading xsl-mode.
