	* xslide.el: Require 'sendmail so can remove test for
	`mail-position-on-field'.  Added adding .xsl and .fo patterns to
	`auto-mode-alist'.

	* xslide-indent.el: Added 'end of xslide-indent.el' at end.

2003-11-06  Glen Peterson <glenpeterson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xslide-font.el: This patch avoids unnecessary regexp-opt calls
	by getting rid of some cut-n-paste code.  Compliments of Ville
	Skytta.

	* xslide-indent.el: New file for indentation variables and
	functions.

	* xslide.el: Split indentation variables and functions into a new
	file: xslide-indent.  I also deleted some old commented-out code.
	No change of functionality.

2003-11-05  Glen Peterson <glenpeterson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xslide.el: Fixes for a number of indentation issues
	including:
		- tags within comments or cdata sections will not
		affect indenting.
	
		- Indent-region will no longer affect text inside 
		comments, cdata, and <xsl:text> sections. You can 
		change the indentation of these sections by pressing
		the tab key manually or hitting delete.

		- Made return take you to the (more or less) proper 
		indentation for the next line.

		- Wrapped the yank function to indent the text after
		it is pasted.

		- Fixed numerous typos in my numerous comments

	* xslide-font.el: Avoided unnecessary regexp-opt calls by
	removing cut-n-paste code.

2003-08-04  Glen Peterson <glenpeterson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xslide.el: Updated version to 0.2.3.

	* xslide.el: Replaced xsl-element-indent-step with xsl-tab-width.
	Added appropriate documentation and ensured backward
	compatibility.

	* xslide.el: Revamped xsl-indent-tabs-mode to make it really work.

	* xslide.el: "pretty-print" indented `xsl-if-to-choose' (it was
	C-style).

	* xslide.el: "pretty-print" indented `xsl-mode' and modified it to
	make xsl-tab-width and xsl-indent-tabs-mode more robust.

	* xslide.el: Tried a new approach for
	`font-lock-mark-block-function' and `mail-position-on-field'
	causing compilation errors on my XEmacs.  Even though this means I
	can't use these features, it allows me to compile and use xslide
	at all (formerly, I commented these lines out manually before
	compiling).
